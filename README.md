KSOS is a project made by me for all-purposes. At first, it's meant to mimic the Windows Phone OS. Later down the road, it changed to be something unique of its own.

#Legend of Dash is a game created by SteveIndoPlayScratch on Scratch. I simply extended the game and added a visual overhaul + lots of new feature and customization. The project's code is on github.com/kenzieshanegd/LegendOfDashWebsite

Both of the project is made and compiled using TURBOWARP DESKTOP.
